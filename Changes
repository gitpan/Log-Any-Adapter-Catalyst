Changes for Log::Any::Adapter::Catalyst

0.11 - Mon Mar  5 10:59:15 EST 2012
    Adds Catalyst::Log to build_requires.

0.10 - Fri Oct 28 13:06:24 EDT 2011
    Initial release. This is a pretty simple adapter that will allow you to
    use Log::Any in Catalyst Models (and anything else your Catalyst app
    uses) and have it all piped to the Catalyst::Log object.
